# StoryHub

StoryHub is a novel and comic reader app for iOS.

## Introduction

StoryHub was made to make reading novels and comics easier and more comfortable, especially for people using multiple sources. It came to be as I could not find another alternative for iOS.

StoryHub currently only supports browsing providers by titles only. For the time being it is recommended to use the provider's native browsing feature for more detailed browsing, and once a suitable entry is found: look it up in StoryHub, add it to the library, and start reading.

StoryHub works by scraping only the most necessary data from the providers, making the reading experience free of ads and other stuff that could worsen the reading experience.

## Novel providers

Currently, StoryHub supports the following novel providers:

* Free Web Novel (<https://freewebnovel.com>) - since 0.9.50.23
* Scribble Hub (<https://scribblehub.com>) - since 0.9.50.26
* MTL Novel (<https://mtlnovel.com>) - since 0.9.50.28
