# Important

Before the actual README, it is important to say that WWWeeb was created and is currently being developed with myself in mind and I am just making the app free and open source so that people like me, who have to keep up with multiple novels and comics from multiple sources and did not manage to find a decent solution to this, do not have to struggle with that anymore (for example, at the moment of writing this, I am keeping up to date with 40+ novels across 5+ sources).

As such, while bug reports are very welcome, feature requests are very likely to end up being ignored unless I would actually see myself using that feature. For the time being I recommend forking the project and implementing the feature yourself.

This stance is also very likely to change in the future depending on the traction this project gets and how far it progressed in terms of features.

# WWWeeb

WWWeeb is a novel and comic reader app for Apple devices.

## Introduction

WWWeeb was made for a very simple reason - to make reading novels and comics easier and more comfortable, especially for people using multiple sources.

That being said, WWWeeb is only meant to be a simple and easy to use reader, and as such supports browsing sources by titles. For more detailed browsing, it is recommended to use the source's native browsing feature and once a suitable entry is found: look it up in WWWeeb, add it to the library, and start reading.

WWWeeb works by scraping only the most necessary data from the sources, making the reading experience free of ads and other stuff that would worsen the reading experience and one might in fact find on some of those websites.

## Novel sources

Currently, WWWeeb supports the following novel sources:
* Lib Read (https://libread.org/) - since 1.0

## Comic sources

Currently, WWWeeb does not yet support comic reading.

## Installation

I have no idea how to install it... YET! I only started learning Swift and SwiftUI a couple days ago (~2024-04-10) and I am still in the process of testing it in the simulator. Once I deploy it to my actual device and use it for a while, I will make a detailed installation guide.
