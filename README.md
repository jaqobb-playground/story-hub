# WWWeeb

WWWeeb is a novel and comic reader app for iOS.

## Introduction

WWWeeb was made for a very simple reason - to make reading novels and comics easier and more comfortable, especially for people using multiple sources.

That being said, WWWeeb is only meant to be a simple and easy to use reader, and as such supports browsing providers by titles only. For more detailed browsing, it is recommended to use the provider's native browsing feature and once a suitable entry is found: look it up in WWWeeb, add it to the library, and start reading.

WWWeeb works by scraping only the most necessary data from the providers, making the reading experience free of ads and other stuff that could worsen the reading experience.

## Novel providers

Currently, WWWeeb supports the following novel providers:

* Lib Read (<https://libread.org/>) - since 0.9.50.1

## Comic providers

Currently, WWWeeb does not yet support comic reading.

## Installation

I have no idea how to install it... YET! I only started learning Swift and SwiftUI a couple days ago (~2024-04-10) and I am still in the process of testing it in the simulator. Once I deploy it to my actual device and use it for a while, I will make a detailed installation guide.
